# Project ALG_Ramanujan1729_Student

The name is derived from a conversation that took place circa 1919 involving mathematicians G. H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan. 
As told by Hardy:

â€œ

I remember once going to see him (Ramanujan) when he was lying ill at Putney. 
I had ridden in taxi-cab No. 1729, and remarked that the number seemed to be rather 
a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 
"No", he replied, "it is a very interesting number; 
it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two positive cubes in two different ways."

"

Your task is to to find the two possible combinations that would create 1729 as described above.

1. [1729](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number))
2. [TaxiCab number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_number)
3. "The man who knew infinity" is a movie about the amazing life of Ramanujan. Recommended and inspiring!
